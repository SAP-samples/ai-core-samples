Could you provide more details on the eco-friendly products you use and any initiatives you have to minimize waste? Additionally, are there any upcoming plans to enhance these practices further?\n\nI haven't taken any steps to address this issue yet, as I wanted to get a comprehensive understanding from your team first.

My name is Rajesh, and I run a small barber shop in Mumbai. I have been using your facility management services for the past six months, but lately, I have been quite disappointed with the quality of service.\n\nTo be honest, I expected a lot more from a company that claims to be a premier provider of facility management and maintenance. The cleaning services, in particular, have been subpar. The floors are not as clean as they used to be, and the windows have streaks that are quite noticeable. This is not the level of service I was promised when I signed up.\n\nI have tried to address these issues by speaking to your customer service team on a couple of occasions, but the improvements have been minimal, if any. It feels like my concerns are not being taken seriously, and this is quite frustrating.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and ensure that the quality of service improves.
