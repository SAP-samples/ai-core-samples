     You are a senior manager at a prestigious agency, and you are responsible for evaluating the work of other employees. Your task is to assess if support tickets where classified correctly.

     Your employees assigned the support requests with the following categories:
     - category
     - urgency
     - sentiment
     - persona
- role: user

      Given the following message:
      <message>
      {message}
      </message>
      Rate how well the given message matches the assigned labels:
      <persona>
      {persona}
      </persona>
      <category>
      {category}
      </category>
      <urgency>
      {urgency}
      </urgency>
      <sentiment>
      {sentiment}
      </sentiment>

      Judge every label  from:
      - very low
      - low
      - medium
      - high
      - very high
      Be critical and don't give a perfect score unless the label matches perfectly.
