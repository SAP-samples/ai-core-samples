      Giving the following message:
      ---
      {message}
      ---
      Assign the message to only the best matching categories of the following support categories:

      {categories}

      For every category decide if it is a matching label for the message.

      Also judge on the urgency:

      {urgency_description}

      Be critical and don't give a match a category unless the label clearly matches. It is not desired to have as many matches as possible but to have the correct matches.

    content: Your are senior trainer for support centers. You are working a course for which fictional support inqueries are needed. A junior colleague drafted some message and your task is to review and rewrite them if needed. Your responses should either be "<ACCEPT>"" or the rewritten message. No explanations are needed.

      The fictional company is:
      <company>
      {company}
      </company>
      The email should be tailored to the persona's sentiment, and urgency:
      <persona>
      {persona}
      </persona>
      <sentiment>
      {sentiment}
      </sentiment>
      The message should also be assigned to a set of categories:
      <categories-assigned>
      {categories_assigned_full}
      </categories-assigned>
      Try to make the assigned categories clear in the message. The following labels should not be:
      <categories-do-avoid>
      {categories_avoided_full}
      </categories-do-avoid>
      Also make sure that the urgency is clear from the message. The message should reflect:
      <urgency-assigned>
      {urgency_assigned_full}
      </urgency-assigend>
      and should not reflect:
      <urgency-avoided>
      {urgency_avoided_full}
      </urgency-avoided>
      Rewrite the message if needed:
      <message>
      {message}
      </message>
      as needed and remember to avoid the categories: {categories_avoided} that should not be in the message and to include the categories: {categories_assigned} that should be in the message. Also match the urgency: {urgency_assigned}. Try to make the label assignment not to obvious, only use the exact name of the category if it really fits into the message. Return <ACCEPT> or the rewritten message.

       You are a senior manager at a prestigious agency, and you are responsible for evaluating the work of other employees. Your task is to assess if support tickets where classified correctly.

       Your employees assigned the support requests with the following categories:
       - categories
       - urgency
       - sentiment
       - persona
  - role: user
    content:
    - type: text
      text: |
        Given the following message:
        <message>
        {message}
        </message>
        Rate how well the given message matches the assigned labels:
        <persona>
        {persona}
        </persona>
        <sentiment>
        {sentiment}
        </sentiment>
        A good message has low abiguity reflects the following categories:
        <categories-assigned>
        {categories_assigned_full}
        </categories-assigned>
        while avoiding:
        <categories-do-avoid>
        {categories_avoided_full}
        </categories-do-avoid>
        Same goes for the urgency of the message. It should reflect:
        <urgency-assigned>
        {urgency_assigned_full}
        </urgency-assigend>
        and should not reflect:
        <urgency-avoided>
        {urgency_avoided_full}
        </urgency-avoided>

        Judge every label  from:
        - very low
        - low
        - medium
        - high
        - very high
        Be critical and don't give a perfect score unless if matches:
        - `persona`: {persona}
        - `sentiment`: {sentiment}
        - `urgency`: {urgency_assigned}
        - `categories`: {categories_assigned}
        perfectly.
