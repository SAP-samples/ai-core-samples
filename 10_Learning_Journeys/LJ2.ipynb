      "---\n",
      "### **High Urgency**\n",
      "- **Determine if the issue is causing a severe immediate impact:**\n",
      "  - Assess if the situation is critical and negatively affecting day-to-day operations or safety.\n",
      "  - Examples include HVAC breakdowns causing discomfort, emergency repairs needed, or immediate safety hazards.\n",
      "- **Check for a sense of urgency in the language:**\n",
      "  - Look for words like \"urgent,\" \"immediate,\" \"critical,\" or \"emergency.\"\n",
      "  - The sender is often insistent that the issue must be resolved as soon as possible.\n",
      "- **Review attempts for previous resolutions:**\n",
      "  - Note if the sender has already tried resolving the issue internally or through initial contact without success and is now seeking urgent intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Medium Urgency**\n",
      "- **Assess the impact on functionality or comfort:**\n",
      "  - Determine if the issue affects the normal functioning or comfort level but is not critically urgent. \n",
      "  - Examples include routine maintenance requests where the system is not fully broken but underperforming, or where cleaning quality has dipped but does not pose immediate safety concerns.\n",
      "- **Identify if actions have been taken or planned:**\n",
      "  - The sender might have tried some steps to mitigate the problem but still needs professional assistance soon.\n",
      "  - The request might indicate a need for resolution within days or weeks rather than immediately.\n",
      "- **Language and tone:**\n",
      "  - The tone may be one of concern and frustration but lacks the immediate demand for resolution.\n",
      "  - Phrases like \"as soon as possible,\" \"prompt attention,\" or \"would appreciate it soon\" are typical.\n",

      "### **Low Urgency**\n",
      "- **Determine the nature of the request:**\n",
      "  - Understand if the topic is informational, routine, or preventative in nature.\n",
      "  - Examples include inquiries about services, scheduling regular appointments, or questions about eco-friendly practices.\n",
      "- **Look for flexibility in timing:**\n",
      "  - The language often implies that the sender is inquiring or planning for the future.\n",
      "  - Phrases like \"at your earliest convenience,\" \"not urgent,\" \"no rush,\" or \"sometime soon\" indicate low urgency.\n",
      "- **Evaluate the presence of immediate impact:**\n",
      "  - Issues raised do not disrupt daily operations or safety.\n",

      "- **Check for absence of strong emotions:** Ensure there are no expressions of frustration, disappointment, high praise, or enthusiasm. The tone should be matter-of-fact and straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Negative Sentiment**\n",
      "- **Assess the tone for dissatisfaction:** Look for phrases that express displeasure, frustration, or disappointment regarding the service or product.\n",
      "- **Identify complaints:** Notice specific grievances about issues like service quality, responsiveness, broken promises, or unmet expectations.\n",
      "- **Look for urgent/problematic language:** Be wary of urgent requests that carry a tone of frustration or dissatisfaction, especially if they imply a failure to meet needs or standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Positive Sentiment**\n",
      "- **Monitor for commendations:** Look for phrases that express satisfaction, appreciation, high praise, or enjoyment of the service provided. \n",
