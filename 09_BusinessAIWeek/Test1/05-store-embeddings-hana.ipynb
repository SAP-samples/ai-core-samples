    "# Store Embeddings for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is especially useful for question-answering use cases that involve large amounts of unstructured documents containing important information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s implement a RAG use case so that the next time you ask about the [orchestration service](https://help.sap.com/doc/generative-ai-hub-sdk/CLOUD/en-US/_reference/orchestration-service.html), you get the correct response! To achieve this, you need to vectorize our context documents. You can find the documents to vectorize and store as embeddings in SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine in the `documents` directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Generative AI Hub Python SDK is compatible with the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction) library. LangChain is a tool for building applications that utilize large language models, such as GPT models. It is valuable because it helps manage and connect different models, tools, and data, simplifying the process of creating complex AI workflows."
